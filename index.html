			<h2>
Problem Area & User Needs	
			</h2>

			<p>
Amateur musicians have benefited greatly from new, cheap recording software and technology.  Almost anyone can learn how to use GarageBand or other similar software.  However, to control the software while remaining engaged in playing the instrument can be a difficult and frustrating task.  How might we make the experience of recording and practicing music at home more seamless? How might we redesign on-the-fly performances?
			</p>

			<p>
A Kinect-based interface would allow musicians to more easily record, playback, and loop their audio recordings or practice tracks. Leveraging audio and gestural feedback, musicians would no longer be forced to depart from their instrument to coordinate the recording process by using a mouse to manipulate sliders and knobs.
